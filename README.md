# Torch Cellars
We created a very nice looking website for Torch Cellars that serves as their business card, their wine portfolio, and their eCommerce website hosted on SquareSpace.com for the frontend and VinoShippers.com for eCommerce. While this was a quick project, we ran into some interesting problems getting SquareSpace and VinoShippers to place nicely. Below, we will document some of the snags we hit and how we overcame them.
